    "more_about_me": "As you already know my name is Lucas, and you already know that I am passionate about Technology. Information Technology is a very big world, if I could I would learn every possible area in IT, I'm passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Information Security, robotics I'm also fascinated, Hardware issues I'm also very interested in, but I know I have to be down to earth and specialize in an area or even two who knows, lol. Now I'm focusing on learning how to develop multiplatform apps, but before that I was studying information security, I learned a lot of basic things about it, and I think every programmer at least had to understand the basis of information security to be able to program more secure apps for its users, but that's another conversation. Going forward I want to specialize in security for mobile applications and android systems, these are my plans for now."
